**Objective:**

To develop an interactive AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, capable of understanding and responding to user queries based on predefined patterns. This project aimed to demonstrate fundamental NLP concepts and practical chatbot implementation.

**Key Activities:**

**.** Environment Setup: Installed necessary libraries including NLTK and SpaCy for NLP functionalities.

**.** Data Preparation: Defined a set of conversational patterns (pairs of regular expressions and responses) to enable the chatbot to understand and respond to various user inputs.

**.** Chatbot Logic Implementation: Utilized NLTK's Chat and reflections modules to create the core conversational flow, allowing the bot to match user input to predefined patterns and generate appropriate replies.

**.** User Interface: Implemented a simple command-line interface for user interaction with the chatbot.

**.** Testing and Refinement: Conducted testing to ensure the chatbot responded correctly to expected inputs and refined patterns for better conversational flow.

**Technologies Used:**

**.** **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.

**.** **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Utilized for building the chatbot, specifically for its Chat module and punkt, wordnet data for tokenization and word understanding.

**.** **Google Colab:** Used for development and execution of the Python script.

**.** **Regular Expressions:** Employed for pattern matching in user inputs.
